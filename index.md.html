  <p> I am a guy from the great <u><em>City of New York</em></u> but move out here to Colorado for college.
    I went camping in Alaska in high school and soon fell in love with the outdoors.
    Now I work for the Forest Service being the outdoorsy man that I always wanted to be as a child.
    And now I'm trying to learn coding so that I can have some supplemental income for my off seasons. </p>
  <p> While in school I majored in <em>Geology</em>, so I know many of the rocks from Monatana to Texas.
    All of these places ive been to during college was during the Geo Field Trips. From there I decided to work in the Forest Service,
    I've worked in Colorado Springs, Telluride and Saguache Colorado. </p>
  <p>I also create custom Denim Jackets. I can take you plain Denim Jacket and make it unique to you by adding patches and anything that you would like. And you will be the only one who has this Jacket.
    <strong>None of my Jackets look the same.</strong> So you know you will have the only one.
